---QUERY---1110199	what is wifi vs bluetooth
 WiFi and Bluetooth are both wireless technologies used for communication, but they differ in their purpose, range, and usage.

WiFi is a type of wireless networking technology that allows devices to connect to the internet or communicate with each other over short distances (typically within a few hundred feet). It uses radio waves to transmit data between devices and requires an access point (AP) or router to facilitate communication. WiFi is commonly used for internet browsing, file sharing, and online gaming.

Bluetooth, on the other hand, is a wireless personal area network (PAN) technology that allows devices to communicate with each other over short distances (typically within 30 feet). It uses radio waves to transmit data between devices and does not require an AP or router. Bluetooth is commonly used for wireless headsets, file transfer, and device pairing.

In summary, WiFi is designed for longer-range communication and is typically used for internet access, while Bluetooth is designed for shorter-range communication and is typically used for device-to-device communication.

---QUERY---1063750	why did the us volunterilay enter ww1
 The United States entered World War I in April 1917, after more than two years of neutrality. The country's decision to enter the war was a result of several factors, including Germany's resumption of unrestricted submarine warfare and the sinking of American ships, as well as Germany's attempts to persuade Mexico to declare war on the United States. Additionally, President Woodrow Wilson's desire to "make the world safe for democracy" and his belief that the war was a moral crusade also played a significant role in the country's decision to enter the war. 
PROB_LOG:-35.09424262443926
 The United States entered World War I in April 1917, after being drawn into the conflict through a series of events and diplomatic crises. Initially, the US maintained a policy of neutrality, but as Germany's unrestricted submarine warfare campaign against Allied shipping intensified, public opinion began to shift towards intervention. The sinking of the passenger ship Lusitania by a German U-boat in May 1915, which killed over 1,000 civilians, including 128 Americans, was a major turning point in American public opinion. Additionally, Germany's resumption of unrestricted submarine warfare in February 1917 and its announcement that it would target all ships, including those carrying American citizens, led to widespread outrage and calls for war. The US government, under President Woodrow Wilson, eventually decided to enter the war on April 6, 1917, after Germany sank several American ships without warning, including the SS Housatonic and the SS Algonquin.

 The United States entered World War I in April 1917, after being drawn into the conflict through a series of events and diplomatic crises. Prior to U.S. entry, Germany had resumed unrestricted submarine warfare, sinking several American ships, including the Lusitania, which killed over 1,000 civilians, including 128 Americans. This led to widespread outrage in the United States and calls for war. Additionally, Germany's Zimmermann Telegram, in which they attempted to persuade Mexico to declare war on the U.S., further strained relations between the two countries. The sinking of the passenger ship SS Housatonic by a German U-boat on March 24, 1917, also contributed to growing tensions. On April 2, Germany announced that it would resume unrestricted submarine warfare and declared the waters around Britain a war zone, leading President Woodrow Wilson to ask Congress for a declaration of war against Germany. The United States entered World War I on April 6, 1917, with the passage of the declaration of war resolution in Congress. 
PROB_LOG:-82.90748856236203
 The United States entered World War I after a long period of neutrality, but ultimately decided to join the Allies in April 1917. There were several reasons for this decision. One major factor was Germany's resumption of unrestricted submarine warfare, which led to the sinking of American ships and the loss of American lives. This led President Woodrow Wilson to ask Congress to declare war on Germany.

Another reason was the Zimmermann Telegram, a message from the German Foreign Office to Mexico urging it to declare war on the United States. The telegram was intercepted by British intelligence and passed on to the U.S. government, which saw it as a clear act of aggression against its own country.

Additionally, there were strong economic ties between the United States and Britain, and the U.S. had significant investments in British war bonds. Many Americans also felt a sense of moral obligation to support the Allies, who they saw as fighting for democracy and freedom.

Finally, the U.S. government was concerned about the potential threat that Germany posed to its own security and the security of its allies in Central America and the Caribbean.
